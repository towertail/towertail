# Towertail Sampler — Spec

A tiny Go binary that runs on each monitored server, reads OS metrics via `gopsutil`, and emits one JSON sample per invocation (one-shot) or one JSON line per interval (streaming). The Mac app bundles all target binaries, pushes the right one to `~/.towertail/towertail-sampler` on first connect, and invokes it over SSH.

This document replaces the earlier `probe.sh` design in [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md). For the rationale behind choosing an sampler over raw-SSH command parsing, see the session summary in that file's §4 intro.

---

## 1. Goals & non-goals

**Goals.** One uniform sample schema across Linux / macOS / BSD; single round-trip per poll; sub-10MB static binary; no host-side dependencies beyond the binary itself; runs fine as the SSH-authenticated non-root user for the metrics Towertail needs (CPU, mem, disk, net, top-N processes).

**Non-goals for v1.** Root-only collectors that require kernel capabilities the SSH user doesn't have: per-process **I/O** counters across all users, per-process open-fd enumeration across all users, disk SMART, temperature. No on-host daemon, no systemd unit, no listening socket. No plugin system. No metric aggregation on the host — the Mac app decimates and stores.

---

## 2. Binary name & location

- **Binary name:** `towertail-sampler`
- **Install path on remote:** `~/.towertail/towertail-sampler` (symlink or direct)
- **Version/metadata file:** `~/.towertail/towertail-sampler.version` — one line, the SHA-256 of the binary the app uploaded.
- **Working dir on invocation:** `$HOME` — no files written.

The sampler never writes files on the host. All state lives on the Mac side.

---

## 3. Invocation modes

### 3.1 One-shot (default for v1)

```
~/.towertail/towertail-sampler --once
```

Collects one sample, prints one JSON object on stdout, exits 0. Exit non-zero on fatal collection error (unlikely — partial data is preferred over failure).

Used by the app like: `ssh host '~/.towertail/towertail-sampler --once'`. Combined with `ControlMaster` this is one TCP round-trip per poll and matches the current 30-second cadence trivially.

### 3.2 Streaming (M4+ / opt-in)

```
~/.towertail/towertail-sampler --interval 1s
```

Emits one JSON object per tick as newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) until stdin closes or the process is killed. Same schema as one-shot. Exits 0 on clean EOF.

Used over a persistent SSH channel when the user wants sub-30s updates without per-sample SSH overhead. The Mac app reads NDJSON off stdout and treats each line as an independent `Sample`.

### 3.3 Control flags

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--once` | (mode) | Emit one sample and exit. |
| `--interval <dur>` | (mode) | Emit every `<dur>` (e.g. `1s`, `5s`, `30s`) until killed. |
| `--version` | — | Print `towertail-sampler <semver> <sha>` and exit 0. Used by the bootstrap handshake. |
| `--self-check` | — | Collect one sample, throw it away, print `ok` + exit 0. Used to verify the binary runs on the target kernel before the app commits to using it. |
| `--no-disk` / `--no-net` / `--no-proc` / `--no-ports` | off | Escape hatches if a specific collector hangs on a weird host — Mac-side config disables it for that server. |
| `--top-n <int>` | 20 | Cap on the process list. Returns the union of top-N by CPU% and top-N by RSS, deduped (so you get between N and 2N rows). `0` disables the cap. |
| `--ports-interval <dur>` | 10s | How often the streaming sampler rebuilds the per-process ports table. Between refreshes the previous snapshot is re-emitted with its `collected_ts` unchanged. Ignored in `--once` mode (always one fresh scan). |
| `--ports-max <int>` | 2000 | Hard cap on connections collected per refresh (passed straight to gopsutil's `ConnectionsMax`). When hit, `ports.truncated=true`. |

No other flags for v1. No config file. No env vars beyond what Go reads by default.

---

## 4. Output schema

One JSON object per sample. Newline-delimited in streaming mode. Fields are stable and versioned via the top-level `v` — bump on breaking changes.

### Field notes

- **`ts`**: RFC 3339 with millisecond precision, always UTC (`Z`). The host sets this; the Mac app trusts it for in-sample delta math but uses its own `Date()` for store keys (hosts can drift).
- **`cpu.pct`**: aggregate across cores, 0–100 (not 0–1). Computed as a ~200ms delta inside the sampler so one-shot mode doesn't need prior state.
- **`cpu.load_1` / `load_5` / `load_15`**: UNIX load average. **Always `0` on Windows** — Windows has no native load-average metric (no `/proc/loadavg` equivalent, no `sysctl vm.loadavg`). The Mac/Windows clients render "—" when all three are zero AND the host is `os=windows`.
- **`mem.used`**: `total - available` on Linux, `app + wired + compressed` on Darwin. Excludes cached/inactive so the percentage matches what a human would call "memory in use."
- **`disks`**: one object per mount after filtering `tmpfs`, `devfs`, `devtmpfs`, `overlay`, `map auto_home`, `squashfs`, `autofs`. If `--no-disk` is set, omit the array entirely (not `[]`).
- **`disk_io`**: system-wide aggregate disk I/O summed across physical block devices (partitions are rolled up into their parent device to avoid double-counting). `read_cum` / `write_cum` are lifetime byte counters (same contract as `net.rx_cum` / `tx_cum`); the Mac app recomputes deltas across polls. `read_bps` / `write_bps` are from a short in-sampler delta window so one-shot mode produces a usable rate without prior state. Omitted when `--no-disk` is set.
- **`net.rx_bps` / `tx_bps`**: delta over the ~200ms self-sampling window in one-shot mode; delta over the actual tick interval in streaming mode. Sum across non-loopback interfaces.
- **`net.rx_cum` / `tx_cum`**: lifetime counters. The Mac app can recompute deltas across polls as a cross-check, and detect counter resets (reboots) when `rx_cum` decreases.
- **`errors`**: non-fatal collector errors (e.g., "netstat returned -1 for iface veth0"). The Mac app logs these but still ingests the rest of the sample.
- **`machine_id`**: optional, read-only. `/etc/machine-id` on Linux, `IOPlatformUUID` on Darwin. Omitted when unavailable (containers without `machine-id`, hardened kernels, etc.). The app uses it as a secondary key to detect hostname renames or collisions — the primary key is still the user-configured SSH target.
- **`procs`**: optional per-process table. Omitted when `--no-proc` is set. `root=true` means the sampler ran with euid 0, so the list is comprehensive across users (Linux: full `/proc` visibility; macOS: `kinfo_proc` with other-user fields filled). `root=false` + macOS means the list only contains the SSH user's own processes. `top_n` echoes the requested cap; `total` is the full process count on the host; `visible` is how many the sampler could inspect (lower than `total` when some entries were gated). `items` is the union of top-N by `cpu_pct` and top-N by `rss`, deduped by pid, ordered CPU-desc. `cpu_pct` is computed from a ~200ms self-sampling delta (same window as aggregate CPU) so it matches `top(1)`'s aggregate-across-cores convention (0..100×cores). `rss` is resident set size in bytes. Per-proc `user`, `cmd`, `threads`, `state`, `ppid`, `start_ts` are best-effort and omitted when the kernel denies access.
- **`procs.items[].read_bytes` / `write_bytes`**: lifetime cumulative per-process disk I/O in bytes. Only present when the sampler can read the counters. **Linux** reads `/proc/<pid>/io`, which is mode 0400 and requires either owning the process or `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` (grant once via `sudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace+ep ~/.towertail/towertail-sampler`); rows without the capability omit both fields. **Windows** uses `GetProcessIoCounters`, which the owning user can call by default — per-proc I/O is populated for the sampler's own user out of the box, and for all users when the sampler runs elevated. **macOS** does not surface per-process I/O via any API gopsutil supports today, so both fields are always omitted there. Clients distinguish `null` (no visibility) from `0` (truly no I/O since start).
- **`ports`**: per-process aggregate of open sockets. Refreshed every `--ports-interval` (default 10s) in streaming mode and re-emitted unchanged in between — `collected_ts` is the wall-clock when the snapshot was actually built and lets the client render staleness. Omitted when `--no-ports` is set. `root` mirrors `procs.root` (matters because non-root on Linux can see system-wide listeners but PIDs for *other users'* sockets come back as 0). `total` is the number of connections gopsutil returned; `truncated=true` when `max_conn` was hit and some connections are not represented. Each `items[]` row is one PID: `listen_tcp` / `listen_udp` are sorted, deduped local ports the process is listening on, `est_out` / `est_in` count outbound vs inbound ESTABLISHED TCP connections (inbound = peer connected to one of our listeners; outbound = we connected to a peer), `udp_sockets` counts UDP sockets without a peer (UDP is connectionless — this is "how many open UDP ports this process holds"), `top_remote_ports` is the most-frequent remote ports for outbound connections capped at 5 entries (so the UI can spot "talking to a lot of :443" patterns). Listening sockets and processes with no sockets are skipped — empty `items[]` is normal on a quiet host. Aggregating server-side keeps the wire payload bounded (≤50 rows in practice) regardless of connection count.

Omitted fields for v1: per-CPU breakdown, temperature, GPU, sensors, per-process network bytes (not exposed by Linux or macOS kernels without root + eBPF / private frameworks). Per-process disk I/O **is** included but may be `null` per-row on Linux without `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` and is always `null` on macOS.

## 5. Build matrix

Built from one Go source tree. `go build` for each target. All binaries are pure-Go where possible (cgo off unless gopsutil forces it on a target).

| Target triple | GOOS / GOARCH | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `linux-amd64` | linux / amd64 | x86_64 servers, EC2 |
| `linux-arm64` | linux / arm64 | Raspberry Pi 4+, Graviton, Ampere |
| `linux-armv7` | linux / arm (GOARM=7) | Raspberry Pi 3, older ARM SBCs |
| `darwin-arm64` | darwin / arm64 | Apple silicon Macs as remote hosts |
| `darwin-amd64` | darwin / amd64 | Intel Macs as remote hosts |
| `windows-amd64` | windows / amd64 | Windows 10 1809+ / Windows Server 2019+. Binary name has `.exe` extension. |
| `windows-arm64` | windows / arm64 | Windows 11 on ARM (Surface Pro X, Copilot+ PCs). `.exe` extension. |

**Seven builds.** Embedded into the Mac/Windows app bundle at `Towertail.app/Contents/Resources/samplers/<triple>/towertail-sampler[.exe]`. Total bundle bloat ≈ 42MB at `-ldflags="-s -w"`; acceptable.

**Windows notes.**
- Binary name is `towertail-sampler.exe`.
- Default deploy path on a remote Windows host is `%USERPROFILE%\.towertail\towertail-sampler.exe`.
- Bootstrap detection runs `ssh host "uname -sm || ver"`; Unix hosts return `uname`, Windows falls through to `ver` (e.g. `Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22000.1]`). The client parses both to pick a triple.
- `scp` to Windows uses forward slashes (OpenSSH on Windows accepts them) and targets the `%USERPROFILE%/.towertail/` path.
- `cpu.load_1/5/15` are always zero (no load-average concept on Windows — see §4).

FreeBSD / OpenBSD support is post-v1 — add `freebsd-amd64` when requested.

## 6. Bootstrap handshake

Runs once per host, and again whenever the Mac app's bundled sampler version differs from what's installed. Owned by `SamplerBootstrap.swift` on the Mac side.

```

**Arch detection.** `uname -sm` → map to one of the five triples. Unknown → fall back to `linux-amd64` and surface "Unsupported host arch — please report" in the card's offline reason.

**Atomic replace.** Write to `sampler.new` then `mv -f` so an in-flight streaming sampler invocation never sees a half-written binary. (Busy `ETXTBSY` on Linux is avoided this way too.)

**Failure modes.**
- `scp` denied (no write to `~/.towertail`): show "Home directory not writable" in the card. Don't retry in a tight loop.
- `--self-check` fails (missing glibc on Alpine, etc.): mark host as `offline(reason: "sampler incompatible")`. Don't retry the upload until user clicks refresh.
- `ETXTBSY` despite atomic replace (old kernel): kill the streaming invocation first, then upload.

---

## 7. Permissions

Running as the SSH-authenticated **non-root** user:

**Works (no privilege needed):**
- `gopsutil/cpu` — aggregate CPU %, load avg, core count (reads `/proc/stat`, `/proc/loadavg` on Linux; `host_statistics` / `sysctl` on Darwin).
- `gopsutil/mem` — total/available/used/swap (reads `/proc/meminfo`; `host_statistics64` on Darwin).
- `gopsutil/disk` — mount list and usage via `statfs`. Mounts the user can `read` on.
- `gopsutil/disk.IOCounters` — aggregate device-level read/write byte counters via `/proc/diskstats` (world-readable on Linux) or IOKit (Darwin, no elevation needed).
- `gopsutil/net` — interface counters via `/proc/net/dev` (world-readable on Linux); `getifaddrs` on Darwin.
- Hostname, uptime, kernel version, arch.
- **Per-process basics** (pid, ppid, name, cmdline, user, CPU%, RSS, threads, state) — `/proc/<pid>/stat` + `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` are world-readable on Linux. On Darwin the sampler sees **only the SSH user's own processes** via `sysctl kinfo_proc` when running non-root — the `procs.root` field in the sample signals which regime is active so the Mac app can show a "running as non-root on macOS" badge.
- **Per-process disk I/O for the SSH user's own processes** — `/proc/<pid>/io` is 0400 but owned by the process's user, so the SSH user sees their own rows without elevation. Other users' rows require `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` (see below). Always omitted on macOS.

**Needs elevated access (auto-detected; sampler degrades gracefully):**
- Per-process **I/O** counters for processes owned by **other** users (`/proc/<pid>/io` is 0400). Granted by `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` on the binary — see §7 bottom. Without it, the sampler still emits the field for the SSH user's own processes and silently omits it for the rest.
- Per-process **open fd** enumeration across other users (`/proc/<pid>/fd` is 0500 user-only).
- `/proc/1/mounts` on some hardened distros — use `/proc/self/mounts` instead. gopsutil does this correctly.
- `/proc/net/sockstat` on kernels with `restricted_net_hostname` — surface in `errors[]`, keep going.
- **macOS**: per-process CPU/mem/cmdline across **other users** requires root (or a signed entitlement + taskgated trust). The sampler auto-detects this via `geteuid() == 0` and sets `procs.root` accordingly so the Mac app can display visibility honestly instead of a misleadingly short list.

**If the user later wants root-gated metrics** (per-proc I/O, cross-user visibility on macOS), the path is `sudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace,cap_dac_read_search+ep ~/.towertail/towertail-sampler` on Linux, or invoking the sampler under `sudo` via SSH. The sampler checks euid at startup and widens the `procs` payload automatically.

**Windows permissions.** `IsRoot()` on Windows maps to an **elevated token** (same thing as a process launched from an "Administrator: PowerShell" session). Non-elevated users already see per-process `read_bytes`/`write_bytes` for their own processes via `GetProcessIoCounters`; running elevated extends that to all users' processes and unlocks kernel-protected entries (PID 0, PID 4 System). Aggregate CPU/mem/disk/net need no elevation. The sampler detects elevation via `OpenProcessToken` + `TokenElevation` and surfaces it as `procs.root=true`.

---

## 8. Trust & supply chain

- **Open-source.** The sampler source is in `sampler/` of this repo. Reproducible build: `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w -X main.version=<semver> -X main.sha=<sha>" ./cmd/sampler`.
- **Signing.** The sampler binary itself is unsigned (Linux doesn't care; macOS targets don't check because `scp` doesn't set `com.apple.quarantine`). The Mac **app** is Developer ID signed and notarized, so users trust the binary transitively through the app bundle.
- **Fingerprint verification.** After scp, the Mac app runs `shasum -a 256 ~/.towertail/towertail-sampler` and compares against the embedded manifest. Mismatch → abort bootstrap, flag as offline with reason "sampler integrity check failed" and log.
- **No network calls from the sampler.** It reads local counters and writes stdout. It does not resolve DNS, open sockets outbound, or contact any server. Grep the source for `net.Dial` — there should be nothing.

```

The Mac-side build script (`app/Packaging/build-samplers.sh` or similar) iterates the five triples, runs the Go build, writes `Towertail.app/Contents/Resources/samplers/<triple>/towertail-sampler` + a `manifest.json` with sha256 per triple.

---

## 10. Testing

- **Go unit tests** in `sampler/internal/collect/*_test.go` — deterministic fakes for procfs/sysctl.
- **Integration** via Docker: `sampler/test/linux-amd64.dockerfile` boots Debian slim, drops a known load, runs `sampler --once`, asserts schema and plausible ranges. Same for Alpine (musl) to catch cgo surprises.
- **macOS integration** has to run on the dev machine directly (no darwin-in-docker). A simple `go test -tags=integration` with `runtime.GOOS == "darwin"` gates.
- **Schema contract test** on the Swift side: round-trip decode every `*.json` fixture in `sampler/test/fixtures/` into `Sample` struct; fail loudly on unknown fields so protocol drift is caught at build time.

---

## 11. Versioning & compatibility

- **Sampler version** = semver, injected via `-ldflags -X main.version=v0.1.0`. Plus short SHA: `v0.1.0+abc1234`.
- **Schema version** = top-level `v` integer. Bumped only on breaking changes. The app refuses to parse samples with `v > appKnownV` (future-proof) and gracefully degrades for `v < appKnownV` (backward-compat).
- **Rollout.** When the app ships a new sampler, first-connect triggers bootstrap replace. If the user doesn't open the app for weeks, old sampler keeps running fine — samples still decode. Forced upgrades are never needed for metrics alone; only if the v bumps.
